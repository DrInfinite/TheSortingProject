# The Sorting Project

<h3 align="center">The consummate compendium for acquiring erudition in the art of categorization</h3>

The Sorting Project is a fun little Open-Source project that I chose to pursue in my free time.
There are quite literally dozens of sorting algorithms and I thought it would be fun to implement
them in multiple programming languages and compare their performance.

I also thought it would be fun to just have a bunch of sorting algorithms in one place, so that
anyone who wants to learn about sorting algorithms can just come here and see them all in one place.

Lastly, I would like to extend my thanks to my friends, whose necessity to learn motivated me to
create this project. I hope that this project will help you in your studies.
